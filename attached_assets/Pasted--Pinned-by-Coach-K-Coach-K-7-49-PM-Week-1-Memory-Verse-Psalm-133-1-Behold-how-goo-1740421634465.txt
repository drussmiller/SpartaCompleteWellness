Memory Verse
Psalm 133:1
“Behold how good and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.”
1) Take two pictures of yourself, one from the front and one from the side. These will be used for you to document your great results. We will remind you to retake these picture each time you go to the next level. Use the Timestamp app to post the date on your pics for yourself.
(YOU WILL KEEP THESE PICTURES. DO NOT POST. THESE ARE FOR YOU. YOU WILL BE VERY EXCITED THAT YOU DID THIS DOCUMENTING.)
2) Weigh yourself in pounds. We know that this is not a true measuring tool of fitness, but it is a measuring tool that we like to track. We will remind you to weigh yourself again each time you go to the next level. (YOU WILL KEEP THESE PICTURES. DO NOT POST. THESE ARE FOR YOU. YOU WILL BE VERY EXCITED THAT YOU DID THIS DOCUMENTING.)
3) Measure yourself around your waist where your belly button is located. Lost inches around the waist is another great measuring tool. We will remind you to measure yourself again each time you go to the next level. (YOU WILL KEEP THESE PICTURES. DO NOT POST. THESE ARE FOR YOU. YOU WILL BE VERY EXCITED THAT YOU DID THIS DOCUMENTING.)

Fuel Plan-( First 4 Weeks):
Assignment:
-Eat three (3) Fuel meals per day, six (6) days per week.
-Upload a proof pic of each of the 3 meals per day on your Group slack channel for points per day.
Here is what makes Level 1-meals an approved meal. Do NOT consume these two items.
1) NO Simple sugars
2) NO Dairy products
1) NO Simple sugars:
Carbohydrates (sugars) are a component of food that supplies energy through calories to the body. The energy value of digestible carbohydrates is four calories per gram. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients that your body needs.  We need all three to be healthy.
The two basic types of carbohydrates that we consume daily are Starches, called Complex carbohydrates (whole) and sugars, called Simple carbohydrates (refined). Whole carbs are unprocessed and contain the fiber found naturally in the food, while refined carbs have been processed and had the natural fiber stripped out.
Examples of whole carbs include vegetables, whole fruit, legumes, sweet potatoes and whole grains used for sustained energy. These foods are healthy. Refined carbs include sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices, pastries, bread, white pasta, white rice and others causing major spikes in blood sugar levels, which leads to a crash that can trigger hunger and cravings for more simple carb foods.
This is the "blood sugar roller coaster" that many people are familiar with.
Only whole carbs for you on this journey. By whole, we mean single ingredient foods in their original form: not mixed or processed with preservatives.
Fuel Foods to eat that contain NO unhealthy Simple sugars:
All Vegetables:
spinach
kale
carrots
broccoli
chard
ginger
sweet potatoes
red potatoes
squash
Whole fruits:
Berries
blueberries
blackberries
raspberries
strawberries

Legumes:

lentils
Nuts:
almonds
walnuts
cashews
Seeds:
chia
pumpkin
Whole grains: choose grains that are truly whole
quinoa
brown rice
whole grain oats
2) NO Dairy products:
The definition of dairy includes foods produced from the milk of mammals, such as cows, sheep, goats. Milk and any food products made from milk, such as cheese, cream, butter, milk yogurt, etc...(eggs are NOT dairy)
IMPORTANT!!!!!
The only sweetener allowed is Stevia it is all natural. Diet drinks or foods with other sweeteners in them are non-compliant.
